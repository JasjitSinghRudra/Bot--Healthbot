In case of follow-up, the user will be asked for their file reference number, and in case of first time, they would be asked their details after which they will be allotted an appointment.

B) Order Medicines

Through this functionality, the user can have medicines available to him/her at their doorstep. By typing ‘order medicines’, the chatbot will first confirm the doctor’s prescription after which it will approve the request and deliver the so referred medicines to him/her.

The status of Covid-19 vaccines, whether the stock is available or not can be checked through the chatbot by simply typing ‘Vaccination Status’.
